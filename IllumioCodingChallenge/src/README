I understand that more compact data structures could be implemented
but are not easily handled by Java. If I were to rewrite this code, 
I would use C++ which allows for unsigned values. Also fields that do 
not have upper and lower bound, a hash map would have been a more efficient
way to compare. Furthermore, if the lower and upper bound are identical
I can only make 1 comparison. 

I believe that my implementation of IP addresses as a long integer type 
comparison is more efficient than simply comparing as individual Strings.
 
For testing I checked the obvious edge cases in my program which are places
where the most significant bit is not the same. I also tested cases that have
ranges in port and IP address and cases which are exact matches and where 
the ip and range falls on the upper or lower bound. If I had more time I would implement 
error handling to catch incorrect input. I would also add further unit testing to 
check more edge cases and create a script to automatically parse them.
